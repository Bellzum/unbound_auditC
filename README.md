## What is Audit C?

Audit C is a voice-powered AR quality control system for diagnostic labs. It witnesses every step of a lab procedure in real-time — replacing trust-based paper checklists with AI-verified, timestamped proof of compliance.

Built for **Rokid AR Glasses** + **TRAE** + **MiniMax TTS**.

## The Problem

In most hospital labs today, ISO 15189 quality control relies on:

- A technician signing a paper checklist ✍️
- A supervisor countersigning ✍️
- **No proof the steps were actually done correctly** ❌

One wrong reagent in a PCR run = false negatives for hundreds of patients. Nobody catches it until it's too late.

***

## The Solution

Audit C uses **voice + AR display** to witness every step:

1. Technician speaks each step aloud
2. AI verifies — green if correct, red alert if deviation detected
3. Every step auto-logged with timestamp
4. One voice command generates a full ISO compliance report

## Demo Flow

```
1. Say "step one done, sample collected"  → ✅ GREEN — VERIFIED
2. Say "contamination detected"           → 🔴 RED — WARNING
3. Say "step two done, reagent added"     → ✅ GREEN — VERIFIED
4. Tap "Generate Report"                  → 📄 PDF audit trail generated

```
